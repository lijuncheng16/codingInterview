    "### Approach 1: Backtracking + Greedy\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "As common strategies for problems of graph traversal, we often apply the methodologies of backtracking or greedy. As it turns out, we can apply both of them for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, backtracking is used to enumerate all possible solutions for a problem, in a trial-fail-and-fallback strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each airport, one might have several possible destinations to fly to. With backtracking, we enumerate each possible destination. We mark the choice at each iteration (i.e. trial) before we move on to the chosen destination. If the destination does not lead to a solution (i.e. fail), we would then fallback to the previous state and start another iteration of trial-fail-and-fallback cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making locally optimal choice at each step, with the intent of reaching the global optimum at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "As suggested by its definition, a greedy algorithm does not necessarily lead to a globally optimal solution, but rather a reasonable approximation in exchange of less computing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, sometimes it is the way to produce a global optimum for certain problems. This is the case for this problem as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each airport, given a list of possible destinations, while backtracking, at each step we would pick the destination greedily in lexical order, i.e. the one with the smallest lexical order would have its trial first.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this greedy strategy, we would ensure that the final solution that we find would have the smallest lexical order, because all other solutions that have smaller lexical order have been trialed and failed during the process of backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we explain how we implement a solution for this problem, by combining the strategies of backtracking and greedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the first step, we build a graph data structure from the given input. This graph should allow us to quickly identify a list of potential destinations, given an origin. Here we adopted the hashmap (or dictionary) data structure, with each entry as <origin, [destinations]>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then due to our greedy strategy, we then should order the destination list for each entry in lexical order. As an alternative solution, one could use PriorityQueue data structure in the first step to keep the list of destinations, which would maintain the order at the moment of constructing the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the final step, we kick off the backtracking traversal on the above graph, to obtain the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the backtracking function, as the bottom case, we check if we have already obtained a valid itinerary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, we enumerate the next destinations in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "We mark the status of visit, before and after each backtracking loop."

In the worst case scenario, we might end up removing all the entries from the queue in getHits method if the difference in timestamp is greater than or equal to 300. Hence in the worst case, a \"single\" call to the getHits method can take O(n)O(n) time. However, we must notice that each timestamp is processed only twice (first while adding the timestamp in the queue in hit method and second while removing the timestamp from the queue in the getHits method). Hence if the total number of timestamps encountered throughout is NN, the overall time taken by getHits method is O(N)O(N). This results in an amortized time complexity of O(1)O(1) for a single call to getHits method.\n",
