If there are multiple such nodes, their relative order doesn't matter and they can appear in any order.\n",

If we remove all these courses from the graph, along with their outgoing edges, we can find out the courses/nodes that should be processed next. These would again be the nodes with 0 in-degree.

More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:\n",
